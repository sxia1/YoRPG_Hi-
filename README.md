## How to Play
### Beginning
   After compiling the code and opening it in the terminal, a prompt will appear asking you to choose your difficulty. Choosing the easy option will result in less monster encounters, while picking beowulf will result in more encounters. To select your difficulty, type in the number and hit enter. Make sure to type the appropriate characters. Failiure to do so will exit you out of the game.

### Character Creation
   Next you will be prompted to choose your role. Listed below is the description for each role you can play. After that, you will be prompted to type the name of your protagonist.

### Game Play
   Then the game begins, and you will encounter monsters. There are three different types you may encounter. You will be assigned one at random. Their details are listed below. You will be asked whether or not you feel lucky. Picking option 1(nay) will make your protagonist do its defauly attack. Picking option 2(aye) will make your character do its specialized attack. Once you clear all monster encounters, you will win and exit out of the game. Upon death, you will lose and also exit out of the game.

## Character
Includes all subclasses of Protagonist and Monster.
======================================================================
## Protagonist
### Mage
Uses mana to increase attack power while keeping defenses the same. However, mana does run out so use it wisely. A mage has lower strength, but a higher attack rating.

### Barbarian
Defense and Strength are both high. Can lower his defense in exchange for double the attack rate when attacking.

### Ninja
Has a chance of dodging (becoming intangible) the Monster's next attack. Defense is much lower and attack rate is very high.
=======================================================================
## Monsters
### Slime
Don't let your guard down from their cuteness, they are still ruthless monsters. Their health is 30 points higher. All other stats are pretty average.

### Orc
Orcs are stronger and have higher defense. We pray for your survival.

### Zombies
Zombies have a lot more health and are much tankier than the other monsters. However, due to rigor mortis, they are also much weaker.
