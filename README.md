##Character
Includes all subclasses of Protagonist and Monster.

## Protagonist
### Mage
Uses mana to increase attack power while keeping defenses the same. However, mana does run out so use it wisely. A mage has lower strength, but a higher attack rating.

### Barbarian
Defense and Strength are both very high. Can lower his defense in exchange for double the attack rate when attacking.

### Ninga
Has a chance of dodging (becoming intangible) the Monster's next attack. Defense is much lower and attack rate is very high.

## Monsters
### Slime
Don't let your guard down from their cuteness, they are still ruthless monsters. Their health is 30 points higher. All other stats are pretty average.

### Orc
Orcs are stronger and have higher defense. We pray for your survival.
